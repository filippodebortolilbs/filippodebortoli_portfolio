## NYT mask use

Github source for data https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/mask-use


## Getting the data 

```{r, read_data}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
url <- "https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/raw/master/mask-use/mask-use-by-county.csv"

nyt_mask_survey <- read_csv(url)

nyt_mask_survey <- nyt_mask_survey %>%
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(mostly_yes= frequently+always,mostly_no = never+rarely,delta = mostly_yes-mostly_no)

glimpse(nyt_mask_survey)
```

## Choropleth map

The FIPS code is a federal code that numbers states and territories of the US. It extends to the county level with an additional four digits, so every county in the US has a unique six-digit identifier, where the first two digits represent the state. 

We will be using Kieran Healy's `socviz` package which among other things contains `county_map` and `county_data`  

```{r}
# America’s choropleths; use county_map that has all polygons 
# and county data with demographics/election data from socviz datafile
# The id field is the FIPS code for the county
county_map %>% 
  sample_n(5)

county_data %>%
    sample_n(5)


glimpse(county_data)
# we have data on 3195 FIPS....

glimpse(county_map)
# ... but to create a map, we translate these 3195 counties to 191,382 polygons!




```

## Joing the files

We have three files

1. `nyt_mask_survey`, our NYT survey data, 
1. `county_map` that has all polygons that define a county
1. `county_data` with demographics/election data.



```{r, join_data}


county_full <- left_join(county_map, county_data, by = "id")

county_masks_full <- left_join(county_full, nyt_mask_survey, 
                                by = c("id"="countyfp"))

```

## Building our choropleth plot

```{r, plot_choropleths, cache=TRUE}

p <- ggplot(data = county_masks_full,
            mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat,
                          fill = delta, 
                          group = group))

p1 <- p + 
  geom_polygon(color = "gray90", size = 0.05) + 
  coord_equal()



p2 <- p1 + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = '#ffffcc', high= '#006837')

p3 <- p1 + 
  scale_fill_gradient2()


p4 <- p1 + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c('#8c510a','#d8b365','#f6e8c3','#c7eae5','#5ab4ac','#01665e'))




p4 + labs(fill = "Mask acceptance, (Mostly Yes - Mostly No)", 
          caption = "“Estimates from The New York Times, based on roughly 250,000 interviews \nconducted by Dynata from July 2 to July 14, 2020”") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 1)) + 
  theme_map() + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Checking for relationships

Does mask use acceptance have any relation with some demographics? Let us explore the relationship between country household income, population, and % who voted republican in 2016

```{r, ggpairs, cache=TRUE}
county_masks_full %>% 
  select(hh_income, pop, per_gop_2016, delta) %>% 
  GGally::ggpairs()+
  theme_minimal()
```
There seems to be quite a moderate negative correlation between the % of people who voted republican in 2016 and mask use acceptance (-0.515). Meaning that as the % of people who vote republican in a particular county increases the difference (delta) between people who mostly wear masks and those who mostly do not decreases.

The difference (delta) between people who mostly wear masks and those who mostly do not  is positively weakly correlated with county population and household income (0.242 and 0.361 respectively). Meaning that people in more populous and more wealthy counties seem to wear masks more. This can be seen in the choropleth map we plotted above as more wealthy and populous areas such as the counties around Los Angeles, New York and major American cities tend to be more accepting of masks use.
